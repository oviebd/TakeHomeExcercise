### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I mainly focused on writing test codes. Writing proper test will increase the confidence of app statbility.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

I spent about 12-14 hours. Most of the time I spend on writing test cases. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

In the UI section I use List to show the list of recipes. List have some limitations on styling and customization. As I do not have any design requirements so I use List instead of LazyVstack. 

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

Ui and some test has duplicate codes. 

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
